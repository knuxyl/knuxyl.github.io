      <description>I recently got a portable android auto head unit to use in my car. It is a T86PND, seems to have been made in late 2023. The unit does not work on my phone or tablet with Android Auto, it connects the blueooth and wifi and the phone says continue on your head unit but the head unit does nothing. So I decided to look at the hardware and software. There is no information about this unit available online, and their manual says Chip - High performance SOC.</description>

      <description>The truth can never be reflected by a copy, nor can it include time, and is only available within the limits of your awareness of the now.
I need to work on the explanation of how free will is an illusion, but trying to find the right words while talking to a non-critical thinker to let them see the truth has proven to be a seemingly endless battle. this idea is paramount to existence, if society had this in it&amp;rsquo;s foundation we would not focus on punishment rather than prevention.</description>
