Humans have the right to hold any weapon(s) and/or tool(s) in any place and time as any entity used to police humans is allowed to hold the same weapon(s) and/or tool(s). This does not apply to humans that have been convicted of a felony, in which case the human has entirely forfeited this right. WIP All manufacturers of weapons and tools used by any entity to police a human or group of humans are required to allow these same weapons and tools to be indiscriminately and easily obtainable by the human or humans being policed. I don\u0026rsquo;t like the easily obtainable part. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to word this, but the idea should be manufacturers shouldn\u0026rsquo;t overprice their weapons so only government can by them, especially dy declaration of the government.\nWIP The price of the most expensive weapon or tool shall not exceed one third of the average salary of the population. The price will not be set depending on who is purchasing the weapon or tool. This is to combat the previous WIP, but I don\u0026rsquo;t like it. There needs to be no difference in price or ways of obtaining based on who is buying or getting it.\nWIP It is not the duty of the government to govern how children are taught and raised. I am not sure how to include that in this without allowing children to obtain firearms, which would be a huge problem. This idea needs a lot more work.
