      <description>https://github.com/knuxyl/dragonframes A while back I made an addon for World of Warcraft 3.3.5a called DragonFrames. It changes the portrait art around the player and/or enemy icon in the top left to whatever they want.
I extracted the original assets from newer World of Warcraft clients and the original, converted them from blp to png, and ran them through an AI upscaler
realcugan-ncnn-vulkan -s 4 -n 3 -i &amp;#34;input.png&amp;#34; -o &amp;#34;output.png&amp;#34; I included the option for the player to have the art dynamically change depending on the level.</description>

      <description>I recently got a portable android auto head unit to use in my car. It is a T86PND, seems to have been made in late 2023. The unit does not work on my phone or tablet with Android Auto, it connects the blueooth and wifi and the phone says continue on your head unit but the head unit does nothing. So I decided to look at the hardware and software. There is no information about this unit available online, and their manual says Chip - High performance SOC.</description>
