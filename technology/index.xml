      <description>I recently got a portable android auto head unit to use in my car. It is a T86PND, seems to have been made in late 2023. The unit does not work on my phone or tablet with Android Auto, it connects the blueooth and wifi and the phone says continue on your head unit but the head unit does nothing. So I decided to look at the hardware and software. There is no information about this unit available online, and their manual says Chip - High performance SOC.</description>
