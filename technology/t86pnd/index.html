So I decided to look at the hardware and software. There is no information about this unit available online, and their manual says Chip - High performance SOC. This is a picture from Amazon of it After taking it apart I noticed they removed all markings from the wifi and soc so they couldn’t be identified, so I was going to need to dig further. The board does not have emmc storage so the OS lives on a small flash chip. I hooked up a CH341a programmer to the obvious soic8 chip and read the contents of the flash storage.\nsudo flashrom --verbose --programmer ch341a_spi -r backup.bin It’s a EN25QH128 16MB SPI flash chip. You can download the backup here.\nI then ran strings on it to see if I could get some clues.\nstrings backup.bin | grep \"a bunch of different strings like os, system, version, etc\" I found out it is a sun8iw19p1 by reading the boot parameters, which is an Allwinner V833. 3 chips use the identifier sun8iw19p1 (V533, V831, V833) but the V833 was the only one with external ram support, which this board has (1gb samsung chip). This means it is a single core Arm Cortex A7. This chip was released in March of 2020, but the Cortex A7 is an architecture from 2011. Allwinner keeps things cheap by using over a decade old cpu technology… But this head unit’s price does not at all reflect that. I found the datasheet which says the A7 supports up to 1.2GHz and h264/h265 video encoding.\nThe main use for these chips seem to be for cameras, which is why this supports a backup camera. The board has a 30 pin fpc port labeled MIPI.\nI failed to get pictures of the board while I had it taken apart, but it looks like a heavily modified Lindenis V833 board (removed ethernet, removed dc port, moved some ports and buttons, usb c upgrade, etc). I was hoping to possibly change the OS to something usable, but this seems daunting. After strings, it looks like it’s using this stack for the OS\nOP-Tee linux u-boot freertos in which I only have experience with linux/u-boot. I tried finding the source code for this but no luck.
