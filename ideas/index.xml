      <description>The truth can never be reflected by a copy, nor can it include time, and is only available within the limits of your awareness of the now.
I need to work on the explanation of how free will is an illusion, but trying to find the right words while talking to a non-critical thinker to let them see the truth has proven to be a seemingly endless battle. this idea is paramount to existence, if society had this in it&amp;rsquo;s foundation we would not focus on punishment rather than prevention.</description>

      <description>After hearing all the fear mongering and lawlessness of the government over banning firearms and the covid-19 mess, I decided to read the bill of rights to see why this lunacy can happen. It became clear very quickly that the founding fathers did not put nearly enough effort into expressing their ideas nor did they have any form of foresight present in any of the legislation. This contributes to a lot of serious problems, especially the 2nd amendment.</description>
