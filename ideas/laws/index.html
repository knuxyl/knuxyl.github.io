It became clear very quickly that the founding fathers did not put nearly enough effort into expressing their ideas nor did they have any form of foresight present in any of the legislation. This contributes to a lot of serious problems, especially the 2nd amendment. Due to modern technology and the pervasiveness of “mind control”, or for the less informed, swaying public opinion, the 2nd amendment’s intention has seemingly become lost in the minds of the people. The idea wasn’t so people can take firearms into schools and kill people, the idea was people should be allowed to arm themselves in self defense of a tyrannical government, but this has been lost and nobody lived through mao’s communist rule, or stalins soviet union, so they have no idea what is would be like if the government is not also governed by the people.\nI have the most fun with conveying ideas in language, so I thought I’d play around with what I would consider a future proof ideal society based “loosely” on what the founding father’s intentions were.\n1) Humans have the right to self-protection and preservation, which explicitly includes unrestricted ownership of any and all weapons and/or tools used by any and all entities used to police them. This explicitly includes no requirements for tests, registrations, waivers, and insurance. Humans have the right to hold any weapon(s) and/or tool(s) in any place and time as any entity used to police humans is allowed to hold the same weapon(s) and/or tool(s). This does not apply to humans that have been convicted of a felony, in which case the human has entirely forfeited this right. WIP All manufacturers of weapons and tools used by any entity to police a human or group of humans are required to allow these same weapons and tools to be indiscriminately and easily obtainable by the human or humans being policed.\nI don’t like the easily obtainable part. I’m not sure how to word this, but the idea should be manufacturers shouldn’t restrict their sales/production to any entity based on arbritrary limitations that only that specific entity can meet.\nWIP The price of the most expensive weapon or tool shall not exceed one third of the average salary of the population. The price will not be set depending on who is purchasing the weapon or tool.\nThis is to combat the previous WIP, but I don’t like it at all. I just have this here to present the base idea, which somewhat coincides with the previous one. There needs to be no difference in price or ways of obtaining based on who is buying or getting it.\nWIP Not a rule, just idea. It is not the duty of the government to govern how children are taught and raised. I am not sure how to include that in this without allowing children to obtain firearms, which would be a huge problem. This idea needs a lot more work. Maybe include that the lowest age a human can serve in any armed role in any entity shall be allowed to obtain firearms.\n2) Humans have the right to ideological expression that does not contradict any ideas presented in any other rule. This explicitly includes the abolishment of freedom to practice religions that violate this rule, including but not limited to Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism). 3) Humans will not endure discrimation due to anything related to their body. This explicity includes color, shape, automony, gender, and appearance. This explicity includes past, present, or future health conditions or treatments. WIP This needs some work. There needs to be discrimination when hiring someone to move heavy objects when they are not capable of doing such. There needs to be a distinction between businesses and government interaction with people and the interaction of people. Like if someones looking for a job or something. Idk where to go with this yet. Maybe “this does not include the abilities of the body”, which may fit. Need to consider handicap people in this. 4) Humans have absolute ownership of their own bodies without imposition on body anatomy, health, or appearance. This explicitly includes the right to refuse health care and bodily manipulation for any reason. 5) Humans have absolute ownership of their personal property without imposition of any requirements, including but not limited to, payments, services, or registrations to maintain ownership of property by any governmental agency. This explicitly abolishes taxation to maintain ownership, such as property tax. 6) Humans have the right to personal property without searches and confiscations unless performed by a policing entity that has obtained a warrant based on credible evidence a crime has been committed including search location(s) and object(s) being searched for. *WIP This may be possible to combine with 7\n7) Humans have the right to personal privacy without monitoring and/or tracking unless performed by a policing entity that has obtained a warrant based on credible evidence a crime has been committed. This explicitly includes any form of digital surveillance, digital tracking, digital monitoring, or later evolutions of these technologies by policing entities. 8) Taxation should exclusively and explicitly only be used on income sources. This coincides with 5 9) No entity can create laws, rules, or procedures that contradict, constrain, or alter the ideas presented here. 10) WIP I want to add something to address the freedom to travel idea. The requirement for business with insurance companies to travel and registration absolutely should not be ok. i think a rule like, any place owned or maintained by taxed money should be free for public use in its intended way without requirement for registrations, insurance, fees, etc.\n11) WIP Humans shall not be restricted access to, production of, or exchange of natural biological plants, mushrooms. This is worded terribly, but the idea of making a plant illegal is bafoonish. Maybe ban synthesizing mind altering substances? but that gets rid of alcohol. Which by statistics is absolutely the worst of them all based on crimes committed. But a foundational idea should be humans shouldn’t be restricted on what they consume, that should be their choice alone. Mind altering substance should be limited to the age they are allowed to serve in any armed organization, whether military or police or security. I’ll get back to this one later.\n","wordCount":"1083","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-02-02T11:47:03-06:00","dateModified":"2024-02-02T11:47:03-06:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://knuxyl.github.io/ideas/laws/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"knuxyl.github.io","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://knuxyl.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://knuxyl.github.io/ accesskey=h title="knuxyl.github.io (Alt + H)">knuxyl.github.io</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://knuxyl.github.io/technology/ title=[technology]><span>[technology]</span></a></li><li><a href=https://knuxyl.github.io/ideas/ title="[ideas (🚫emotions)]"><span>[ideas (🚫emotions)]</span></a></li><li><a href=https://knuxyl.github.io/search/ title="[search] (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>[search]</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://knuxyl.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://knuxyl.github.io/ideas/>Ideas</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">WIP New Bill of Rights</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-02-02 11:47:03 -0600 CST'>February 2, 2024</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>After hearing all the fear mongering and lawlessness of the government over banning firearms and the covid-19 mess, I decided to read the bill of rights to see why this lunacy can happen.
